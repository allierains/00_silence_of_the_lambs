Please open up SpecRunner and look at all our poor failing tests.

It's up to you to make them pass one at a time. 

Write the correspoding code inside `lib/`

# Completion

Completion for this will be when the lambs have stopped screaming.

Install Jasmine for Node

```
$ npm install -g jasmine
```

Run your tests with Jasmine

```
$ jasmine
```

Write your code in `lamb.spec`

Remove the `x` from pending specs to continue.
